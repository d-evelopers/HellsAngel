# Hell's Angel #
Hell's Angel is a game where you somehow find a devil girl in your
care. Neither of you know where she came from, but if she is going to
live with you, she is going to have to live under your rules.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/d-evelopers/HellsAngel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/d-evelopers/HellsAngel)

## Prerequisates ##
You will first need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) insatlled on
your system to develop or use Hell's Angel.

...and if you wish to contribute changes, you will also need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Installing ##
First thing you'll need to do is get the codebase from
[GitHub](https://github.com/d-evelopers/HellsAngel).

You can either download a ZIP containing the code from the above
linked page, or by running the following command in the folder you
want to download the code to:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/d-evelopers/HellsAngel.git
```

And then, when you are in the folder, run the command:
```sh
npm install
```

This will download all of the things needed to run and develop Hell's
Angel.

After that, you have two choices, you can either run the program
normally like so:
```sh
npm start
```

Or, you can run it in debug mode like:
```sh
npm run dev
```
In addition to starting the game, this will:
- Show the menubar of the application
- Open the reaction editor
- ...and drop the console to a REPL
